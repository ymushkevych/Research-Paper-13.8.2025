# Abstract

Despite the importance of economics in the modern world, schools offer very little in the way of a hands-on approach to understanding investment and fund management. This can compromise an individualâ€™s certainty on economic topics in their future, and can cause them to invest rashly and without counsel, even when many retirement funds are linked to market shares. This disconnect from the reality of investments can severely traumatize some individuals and potentially leave them in a worse position than they started in. This paper aims to demonstrate a low-risk yet high-reward method of teaching students how to properly invest in stocks and manage funds before they are released into the world as adults. The current system set in place seems to be very lackluster and unable to properly educate the future of this country. The system proposed in this paper, however, should ideally offer an easily digestible yet accurate model that can be adapted to any classroom need. This paper concludes by outlining a possible experimental setup for the model and a potential study that will measure the effectiveness of the new model against existing material.
