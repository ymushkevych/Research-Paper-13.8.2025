The code for this project was written in AppScript â€“ a free feature of Google. If you wish to run your own version of the SSE, you'll have to copy and paste the code into an AppsScript Project. 

In GitHub, I designated the code files as .js as AppsScript seems to run on a modified version of JavaScript. HOWEVER, in the AppsScript IDE, the files end in .gs (Google Scripts, I'm presuming)
